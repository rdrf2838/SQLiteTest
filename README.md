# SQLiteTest
This is an Android application for keeping track of one's friends. I find it hard to remember all the details about my friends, which is my primary motivation for making this. I am also using this app to practice my SQL skills under Part IA Databases.

My endgame: 

MY IRL - Me, You, In Real Life

Imagine an app that manages your interactions with people for you. Maybe you went out for coffee with your friend and chatted about your hobbies, or your boss speaks to you about something important. This app records all these interactions for you (possible, e.g. bluetooth tech used during Covid), and allows you to review the state of all your interactions with all the people you know, informing you when you might want to meet up with people who you haven't met up in a while, or coming up with topics the next time you meet with your friend based on previous topics etc. 

Security: possible by storing all information on local database

Monetisation: more effective algos, ads in suggestions. But the main selling point is that the type of data collected is very personal and can be used to a great extent for tailoring ads. User agreement: give up data in exchange for suggestions, otherwise app becomes barebones information
